# go-blockchain-centralized

A framework for a docker based blockchain with a centralized 'DNS' written in Go. 

Run the Docker DNS file to get started. 

Then create any amount of nodes by running the Docker node file. 

The nodes will greet eachother and share any transactions and coins they find/mint.
